              A collection of 50 avatars that give you membership access to The
              Garden. It starts with exclusive streetwear collabs, NFT drops,
              live events, and much more that will be revealed over time.
              Community ownership in Azuki allows for a new genre of media which
              the world has yet to explore. An Azuki is your identity in the
              metaverse â€” let's build together. The Garden is a corner of the
              internet where art, community, and culture fuse to create magic.
              The lines between the physical and digital worlds are blurring and
              the rules are being rewritten.
